4.1.3 Combined 10 files to make master bias for -5 and -10 deg. As can be seen in 
      the excel sheet the values decreased by a factor of around 1/sqrt(N_images)

4.2.2 The master bias was subracted from each dark exposure manually using fttools 
      for both -5 and -10 deg. It is believed that the median should be used for 
      the "typical counts" because the dark current is present in very few pixels 
      and therefore is offseting the data. This will increase our uncertainty. The
      overall uncertainty should be delta_x_med=delat_x_mean*sqrt(pi/2) (for large
      numbers)

4.2.3 Linear regression done in excel. The dark current in electrons per pixel per
      second is equal to the slope of the regression which is 0.3673 for -5 deg and
      0.1755 for -10 deg.

4.3.1 Average of 10 flat fields was taken using fttools and was normalized against
      the mode. (master_flat_field_norm.FIT)

4.3.2 DS9 not working on Uhura??

4.5.1 The gain can be measured by taking the sqrt(sigma_counts/sqrt(N_mean)). A
      comparison between the real value and the calculated is shown in the excel
      file. It is offset by about ~0.2 probably because we assume perfect quantum
      efficency

4.6.1 Spectrographic data was combined into a master flat using pyraf

4.6.2 ds9 not working
